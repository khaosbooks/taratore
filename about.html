              <p>As an avid reader from a young age, Tar Atore got introduced to queer fiction fairly late and even more so to queer characters in her favourite genres - fantasy and science fiction. </p>
              <p>Now, she focuses on writing those genres by building relationships between her queer characters that enhance the plot without taking over the genre. She's a fan of subtle romances that smack and epic scales that don't feel overwhelming. She has a habit of playing with common tropes and twisting her plots.</p>
              <p>When not writing, you can find her still with a book at hand and cat in lap! Or more likely on her computer, designing, coding, drawing, and working with other indie authors to get their covers, maps, and typesets looking as best as they can be!</p>

              <h4>Writing history <span class="accordion-icon">‚ñæ</span>
              </h4>
            </a>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>I started writing with RPs on MSN Groups (does that tell you my age? üòâ) as a way to better my English. I loved it enough to go solo and let the worlds in my head grow‚Ä¶ except for a long period of time right after starting my undergraduate degree in Professional Writing. I still remember, first class in my major, huge lecture hall of 800+ students, and the professor started our first year at school with all the reasons why we shouldn‚Äôt become writers. Inspiring üôÑ</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, I listened. I still did some small pieces of writing here and there, and I self-published a collection of short stories after graduating, but I had lost the spark and then I stopped writing completely for about 6 years.</p>
              <p>Then, I wanted to get back into writing my story‚Äî-the one I had been working on for over 10 years before an asshole crushed my dreams. I found a Discord server with the support and people to push me.</p>
              <p>That year, I started writing what was supposed to be a short novel about one of the minor characters from my main story just to get me back in the right mindset. 200k words later and I started a monthly word tracker. 200k words more later, and I was on ‚Äúbook 6‚Äù of that short novel. I started editing it and then serializing it online, and then a friend told me about a contest on RoyalRoad.</p>
              <p>Enter our co-writing project! That was so much fun and I can‚Äôt wait for us to get back into it--but the real turn in my writing came about when that same friend convinced me to join a writing derby. I planned, drafted, edited, wrote, and published <a href="/books/soultaming.html">Soultaming the Serpent</a> in 3 months! I now consider this my debut novel. Since then, I :</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Published a sci-fi short story inspired by an art contest</li>
                <li>Published a novella set in the same world as God of Discovery</li>
                <li>Gutted the GoD world completely to give it the history it deserves</li>
                <li>Submitted a short story for an author anthology</li>
                <li>And am expanding the world of Terminal Solution with both writing and art</li>
              </ul>

            <h4>Where do you get your ideas? <span class="accordion-icon">‚ñæ</span>
            </h4>
          </a>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Most commonly--by staring off into space. A lot more realistically--by consuming other media and thinking up alternatives. Sometimes, I see a prompt or read a book or watch a movie, and there is something about it that tickles--so I would let that tickle sit. And then... I will forget about it. If it doesn't leave me or if starts growing, it gets added to my note file of ideas. And again, left to simmer. When a new idea comes up that can be added to that one, the two merge. And then I start working on tying them in and any new ones together!</p>

            <h4>How long does it take to write a book? <span class="accordion-icon">‚ñæ</span>
            </h4>
          </a>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>I think the answer to that one is: Yes. üòÖ In all seriousness though, I have been able to write, edit, and publish a book in 3 months. I wrote a short story in one night. I was able to write the 1st draft of 6 books in a year and a half. I have also taken a piece of writing from 20+ years ago and turned into a novella, and I have also been plotting the same story for 10+ years. It's honestly a toss-up for me... </p>

            </h4>
          </a>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>This is mostly a yes, but also a no. I let the bunnies do their thing and merge and merge and merge until they become a mess of notes that has to be organized. That is where my structure maps come into play--they help me figure out the pacing and what's missing and where, but those structure maps consist of bullet points of what the story should include rather than detailed plans.</p>

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>I don't have one and I will stick by that. I tried the daily thing and it led to two things: burnout and a dislike of writing. The moment writing starts feeling like work or starts being mentally exhausting, I am going to drop it. I am a burst writer--I can do 10k in a day and then no writing for a month or more.</p>

            <p>At this time: No. I recently moved back to Europe and am living in a non-English-speaking country. I still write in English and though flights within Europe are cheap--I don't have the courage to go trapaising to another country just yet to put myself out there like that!</p>

            <p>Similarly to the events, the answer at the moment is: No. I used to offer signed and goodies packages of <em>Soultaming the Serpent</em> via my Ko-Fi store, but shipping fees put me in the red before I moved an ocean away from my main readership.</p>

            <p>You may have seen the name in a few places on this site by now, but the short of it is: my business. I've been working full-time as a freelance designer for over 10 years to help authors. I used to do it all--marketing, editing, branding, art... so many things.</p>
            <p>Over the past few years, I've narrowed down my focus on cover design, typesetting, and map drawing for indie authors in the fantasy and sci-fi genre. As of 2026, I will be hiring additional designers, editors, publicists, and more to grow a team, while also offering branding, website creation, character art, and more. The goal will be to help marginalized indie authors find all their needs in one place. This team will be working under the name KhaosBooks.</p>
