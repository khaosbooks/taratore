          <h2>Soultaming the Serpent</h2>
          <p>Jun was barely ten years old when the last dragon died.</p>
          <p>Half a century later and Jun still dreams of the rain that hasn’t fallen since. Her mundane life takes a turn when she encounters Aurel, who she suspects may be the one that holds the key to restoring balance and is destined to find the elusive serpent from the prophecy.</p>
          <p>Joined by Casey, Jun’s closest friend and the village brewer, the three embark on a journey to unravel the prophecy's intricacies, figure out what the serpent's role truly is, and why the dragon has to die, not knowing they are being watched. </p>
          <p>Follow our trio as Jun discovers a love of adventure, Casey’s devotion takes an unexpected turn, Aurel spills his secrets like dust in the sand, and the three of them discover the true power of their bond. </p>

          <p>She took that first step, and her entire body trembled.</p>
          <p>The cart in front of her kept her on her feet.</p>
          <p>The next step was easier, but her knees still shook.</p>
          <p>The step after that even more so, and she stopped leaning on her cart so much.</p>
          <p>The walk to the split in the river was much shorter than she remembered it as a child. It was so easy to just go. The sun was hot and shining right into her eyes, but she used the kohl powders her mama taught her to paint long ago to protect her eyes. The sands were dancing to a hot wind, but she had her mother&rsquo;s old scarf to keep her long silver hair and neck protected.</p>

          </a>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>With every step she took, she felt surer of her decision. She was doing this! She was going! She had never been to the neighbouring village, but she knew that all she had to do was follow the dry riverbed. When the sky darkened, Jun lit her mama&rsquo;s old lantern where it hung off the cart to light her way.</p>
            <p>By the time she saw lights and houses in the distance, the sun had long set.</p>
            <p>Then she made it, but this was not a village. It was an entire town!</p>
            <p>Instead of the single road that ran through her village there were at least a dozen. Instead of the empty and abandoned houses, all of these had opened doors and lights above them. Instead of the handful of villagers that went out at night to search for water and materials for their crafts, the main street was buzzing with so many people that Jun felt dizzy.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Weaver!&rdquo; somebody called out in the crowd and Jun stumbled.</p>
            <p>She looked around but nobody caught her eye, though a few others looked at her. Then she saw a waving hand and a familiar face.</p>
            <p>Marcus. He was a travelling merchant who hadn&rsquo;t been to their village in years. Jun loved it every time he visited in the past with his many trinkets and useless knick-knacks that she spent all her coppers on. He had stopped visiting her village because Jun was the only one who ever bought anything from him and the sweat to travel there just for her was not worth it.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a long time! What brings you here?&rdquo; Marcus circled his stall when she came up to him and then eyed her cart. &ldquo;Trading?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; Jun lied through her teeth with a smile.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You must have left when the sun was still up. Do you want some water?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;How many coppers will that cost me?&rdquo; Jun laughed but her box of water was empty where it hung on her belt. She wanted to drink, no matter how much it cost.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;For you? I&rsquo;ll fill up your box for half a dozen.&rdquo; That was a lot. Jun sometimes forgot how Casey pampered her by trading water for her broken weaves, old pottery, and finicky tastes.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Twice then, please,&rdquo; Jun handed over her box along with a dozen coppers.</p>
            <p>He hid behind his stall and filled her box from a large cask, handed it over, and then refilled it once Jun had drained it. She took a few sips from the new one and Marcus grinned, wiggling his fingers. When Jun gave him the box back, he topped it up with a finger held to his curved lips.</p>
            <p>Marcus was a good boy. He was too ambitious, but he was always fair to Jun. Too many times, he marked down the price for the glass figurines Jun bought from him. Too many times, he gave her a wooden puzzle box for free if she bought enough other things. He was too nice to her and probably that was why it took no sales pitch at all for Jun to empty half her purse and fill her cart.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Do you want to pay a kid to run this down for you?&rdquo; Marcus asked as he tied a delicate wooden piece in straw and twine. It looked like a companion to a puzzle piece Jun had purchased from him over two decades ago.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You noticed my purse is still heavy?&rdquo; Jun joked and fingered the feathers of a dream catcher. For that one, she wanted the sales pitch and the story. &ldquo;How much was this one again?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You get one of the local kids to carry everything for you and I&rsquo;ll throw it in for a copper only.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You make a tempting offer.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The ground is still hot. I don&rsquo;t want my favourite customer to die of heat trying to carry all this back.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that old,&rdquo; Jun scoffed, but she gave him an extra copper anyway.</p>
            <p>Marcus grinned wide and said, &ldquo;Leave your cart with me. I&rsquo;ll get a kid to run it to you first thing when the sun sets tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Jun thought about having to drag the cart back, even at night, and wanted to swear. But this was her mama&rsquo;s cart. She didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable leaving it behind. &ldquo;Hmm, maybe another time. There are other stalls I want to see.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;They have nothing on me!&rdquo; Marcus boasted with a grin. &ldquo;But fine. I&rsquo;ll get the kid to run them down in a new cart, but you won&rsquo;t get to keep it!&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a breeze, Marcus.&rdquo; Jun smiled at him. &ldquo;Thank you. It&rsquo;s always a pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;And mine! I&rsquo;m glad you finally made it out here. I&rsquo;ve missed you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Jun tried not to take it as an insult, but she felt the shimmering anger try to return. He meant nothing by it, but it reminded her too much of Casey&rsquo;s words. She bid him goodbye and went into the first tavern she found. Their cactus beer was too sweet for her tastes and the tortoise meat was too stiff, but they were both enough to strengthen her for an entire night of browsing the rest of the stalls.</p>
            <p>The town was much livelier than her village and had many more things to offer and soon, Jun&rsquo;s entire purse was empty save for a handful of coppers she had hidden in her shoe. Her cart, however, was much lighter with all of her weaves traded away.</p>
            <p>When the sky to the east started brightening, it was time to go home.</p>

          <div class="review-card">
            <blockquote class="review-text"> "I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Older characters, a dragon, queer rep, a prophecy: this story had so much to offer. As much as I fawned over every detail of the dragon, the relationship between the three main characters was the best part, especially when Jun realizes that all forms of love are valid and important, even those that are not intimate or romantic.</blockquote>
            <blockquote class="review-text">A fun read that I will certainly pick up again for a reread." </blockquote>

It's such a good story, such a touching story, with memorable and well-rounded characters. Fantastic.

          <div class="review-card">
            <blockquote class="review-text">"Soultaming the Serpent feels fresh. Yes, it has a chosen one, dragons, and a hero on a mission. The twist? Jun, our hero, is a 60-year-old aromantic outsider who is more annoyed than excited about going on this adventure. There's also a queer love triangle, but not in the way you'd expect." </blockquote>
            <blockquote class="review-text">Jun is a likable character with an intriguing backstory, a strong sense of duty, and a weight of nostalgia on her back. Her only friend, Casey Brewer, who owns the village tavern, is also a well-written character. Twice-widowed and an amputee, Casey remains good-natured and surprisingly romantic.</blockquote>

                    <p>Jun was raised by her two mothers at the village. While her mama left consistently on trips to other villages and even the capital, Jun never joined her. Instead, she remained with her mother and learned how to weave. Over time, she became comfortable with this. Even after her mothers left, she never wanted to get married, have kids, or make any romantic relationships with anyone in her village.</p>
                    <p>She spent most of her time daydreaming and thinking of all the things she wanted to do, but never has. All the while, she mended clothes for others in the village or created new outfits for them on request. Jun is best friends with Casey, the village tavern owner, and she has a very picky palette—Casey constantly uses her to test his new drink recipes.</p>

                    <p>Casey has always been able to fall fast and fall hard. He was married at a young age to a local girl, who gave him three sons before passing away. Afterward, he fell in love with the son of a travelling merchant and the two got married. Casey, once again, outlived his spouse.</p>
                    <p>During one of his outings to the well, a snake scared his horse, throwing him off. The snake bit and killed his horse, the animal falling on his leg. By the time he was found, his trapped leg was no longer salvageable and he had to have it amputated. Since then, Casey alternates between a wooden leg and crutches when the prosthetic hurts too much, and has a fear of snakes.</p>
                    <p>He hasn't let either his bad luck in love or his lack of a limb stop him from continuing to pursue love—even if it was in the form of Jun who ignored all of his flirtatious attempts, but still remained his friend. Casey loves her as a friend as well, and he happens to find another form of love for her during their adventure together.</p>

                    <p>Aurel's past is shrouded in mystery. The little Jun and Casey have been able to get out of him during idle conversation is that he was originally from one of the northern countries. From the way he acts around them though, they both believed him to be a spoiled little lordling, used to having others do the work for him.</p>
                    <p>Yet even with his lazy demeanour and sometimes rude dismissals, he is handy with a tool and knows the basics of housework.</p>
                    <p>Due to finding him the night it rained for the first time in 50 years, Jun believes Aurel is the chosen one meant to find the serpent and bring back the dragon. Aurel constantly refuses her pushes, and then refuses Casey's as well when the other starts believing Jun after a messenger from the Empress informs their village that the Chosen One has awakened.</p>

              <h4>The cycle</h4>
              <p>While every cyrcle is a different length, they all consist of the same thing: the Chosen One is born, is sent to look for the Serpent, <span class="spoiler">soultame the serpent to help it become the dragon</span>, and then the Chosen One and the Dragon remain together until the dragon's death.</p>
              <p>Once the dragon dies, its soul is reincarned and it's the chosen one's job to prepare to become the next serpent and wait for the next chosen one. </p>

              <h4>The broken cycle</h4>
              <p>Due to the love the Chosen One had for their dragon, they found a way to break the cycle. Unfortunately, they were unable to stop the dragon from deteriorating further and dying anyway.</p>
              <p>The dragon's soul was meant to be reborn over the next year, but the Chosen One--already transforming into the serpent--found a way to halt that reincarnation for a few decades.</p>
              <p>The delay wasn't long enough to actually break the cycle, though introducing a new soul (or two) into it was.</p>

              <h4>The last dragon</h4>
              <p>It is said that the dragons once lived in multitude in the land among the people. They brought rain, staved off storms, and helped the people of the land. They were loved and worshipped. </p>
              <p>However, neighbouring countries became jealous. They started sending people to either hunt and kill the dragons, or tempt them away. Over time, the dragons scattered across the lands and they were no longer easy to find or ask for help.</p>
              <p>In one of those far off lands, a dragon fell in love with a human--but it knew they had no way to be together. Not unless they took the power of the storms and tied their souls together. Only, they didn't expect that to mean that it would never again rain without a dragon calling it forth.</p>
