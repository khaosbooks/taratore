          <h2>Wired Womb</h2>
          <p>Evelyn somehow fell through the cracks in the system. She was almost a decade past the “proper” marrying age and working a job that was so low on the rung she could practically do it with her eyes closed. With a mind for tech and a rebellious spark, she’s been hiding in plain sight, designing an AI companion to fill a void that she never actually felt.</p>
          <p>But when the church steps in to finally arrange her marriage, Evelyn knows it’s time to make the ultimate choice. She’s smart enough and she knows it, so she applies to become a Tech Acolyte—a role reserved for men—and makes a bold decision. She’ll fight the system that tries to control her body.</p>
          <p>With the help of her AI companion and someone who sees her for her skills instead of her womb, Evelyn will do whatever it takes to not only secure her own future but, possibly, that of all that’s left of humanity.</p>

          <h3>Excerpt</h3>
          <p>Evelyn has a choice to make, though it felt like the options were out of her control. Like everything else. Slipping through her fingers from the moment she was born. But this one&hellip; this one she could do. She stared at the two tickets on her screen and tapped a finger on the plastic surface of her desk right under the light of her keyboard.</p>
          <p>Both tickets had the same start time&mdash;a glance at the clock revealed it to be thirteen minutes away&mdash;and the same due date. One was from a regular client of hers that always asked for her first and she rarely turned down. It didn&rsquo;t matter that it paid better. It was the work that was the problem. It was&hellip; boring. It was something she could do without even thinking. But that meant she had time to think about other things. Things she didn&rsquo;t want to think about.</p>
          <a class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false">
            <h5>Read more... <span class="accordion-icon">▾</span>
            </h5>
          </a>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>The other ticket was something new&ndash;something she hadn&rsquo;t worked on before.</p>
            <p>She pulled up the details of it on her screen. There was no name for the person who assigned it, but they had already rejected at least five offers from other code cleaners. The details were sparse and as soon as she accepted it, she would have to sign an NDA. Not that she had anyone to share that information with.</p>
            <p>Other than the fact that it was something <em>new</em>, something to get her thinking and focused, there was also one line of text in the ticket that kept her hesitating. It didn&rsquo;t outright say it, but right there&mdash;</p>
            <p><strong>Wiping old base protocols.</strong></p>
            <p>That was&hellip; that wasn&rsquo;t common. Not many programs required for the old base protocols to be wiped. If a base protocol was to change, it would usually be easier to just restart the program and copy-paste the new code needed. There were times where that wasn&rsquo;t the best option, but they were rare. Mostly, they had to do with older programs that were still running at the time of the cleaning.</p>
            <p>Evelyn started scratching at the plastic of her desk, her nail finding a groove she had started creating years ago.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; Evelyn asked the air around her quietly.</p>
            <p>There was no reply. She pulled her nail out of the plastic groove and poked at the sphere under her screen. &ldquo;I asked, what do you think?&rdquo; she repeated her question.</p>
            <p>The sphere lit up, a soft green glow that was so different from the red and blue lights outside that signified the beginning and end of each day&rsquo;s cycle.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Sounds different,&rdquo; Percipio replied.</p>
            <p>Evelyn tore her eyes away from the ticket description and to the posting details. Someone else applied to clean the code. They were rejected almost immediately.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Worth a try, right?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; Percipio was in a grouchy mood.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Worth a try,&rdquo; Evelyn confirmed, and applied. She started scratching at the groove in her desk again as she waited. When the timer was down to five minutes, she switched her screen to the other ticket. Just as she was about to hit the apply button, she got a confirmation on the unknown ticket.</p>
            <p><strong>Rejected. </strong></p>

                    <p>The Deacon is one of the most powerful technical minds in the Church, operating with a special clearance that allows him to work on forbidden projects, from angel cores to demon tech.</p>
                    <p>He is pragmatic, scatterbrained, and intensely focused on his work, often needing his assistant, Marilyn, to keep him organized and on schedule. He has a history of being called before the Cardinal Council to explain his ethically questionable research.</p>
                    <p>He is initially drawn to Evelyn's skills in creating code that can hide from the Church's surveillance systems. He sees her as a tool to advance his own goals.</p>
                    <p>His primary project is the creation of an artificial womb to solve humanity's declining birth rate, a goal he claims is for the species' survival but is later revealed to be driven by a personal desire for a legacy, as he carries the genetic marker for Huntington's disease.</p>
